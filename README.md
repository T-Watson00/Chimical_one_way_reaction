analysis about A to C, 2A to C, A + B to C reaction

Solve the Ordinary Diffarential Equation(after this, use ODE) and plot the molar concentration of A,B,C and prot profit model.
Then find the best time.

According from the plot of pusuedo first order reaction and secound order reaction,
the pusuedo first order reaction explain very well when one hand is much larger than the other hand.
